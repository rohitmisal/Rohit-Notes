========
Docker
========

-> Docker is a containizeration platform

-> Docker is used to simplify application deployment process in Multiple Environments
		(DEV, SIT, UAT, PILOT and PROD)

-> Docker is used to package application code + application dependencies for easy execution

-> Using Docker we will create Docker images

-> Docker Image contains App code + App dependencies

-> We can run docker image in any machine. It will take care of dependencies & execution

-> When we run Docker image, it will create Docker container

-> Docker Container will run our application




===============
Virtualization
===============

-> Installing Multiple Guest Operating Systems in one Host Operating System 

-> Hypervisior S/w will be used to achieve this

-> We need to install all the required softwares in HOST OS to run our application

-> It is old technique to run the applications

-> System performance will become slow in this process

-> To overcome the problems of Virtualization we are going for Containerization concept

=================
Containerization
==================

-> It is used to package all the softwares and application code in one container for execution

-> Container will take care of everything which is required to run our application

-> We can run the containers in Multiple Machines easily

-> Docker is a containerization software

-> Using Docker we will create container for our application 

-> Using Docker we will create image for our application

-> Docker images we can share easily to mulitple machines

-> Using Docker image we can create docker container and we can execute it

============
Conclusion
============

-> Docker is a containerization software

-> Docker will take care of application and application dependencies for execution

-> Deployments into multiple environments will become easy if we use Docker containers concept




Container = Application Code + Application Libraries + Application Dependencies


Docker is a containerization software

Using Docker we will create Docker image

Docker Image = 
 Application code + Application libs (maven dependencies) + Application Dependencies( java, tomact, mysql etc...)

Once docker image is created then we can use jenkins to run docker image in multiple machines

Jenkins is just deployment software. We will use jenkins to run docker images in all environments

When we run Docker image it will create Docker container

Docker Container means Runtime instance of our application


===================
Docker Architecture ?
===================

1) Dockerfile

2) Docker Image

3) Docker Registry

4) Docker Container


-> Dockerfile contains set of instructions to build docker image. In dockerfile we will specify which sotwares are required to run our code/application.

-> Docker image means a package which contains application code + app libs + app dependencies

-> Docker Registry is a place which is used to store docker images for future purpose 

		Ex: Docker Hub, Amazon ECR etc....

-> Docker container is runtime instance of our application. When we run Docker Image it will create Docker Container. Inside Container our application and application dependencies will be available.

=======================
Install Docker in Linux VM
=======================

-> Loging into AWS account

-> Create Linux Virtual Machine using Amazon Linux AMI

-> Connect to Linux VM using MobaXterm

-> Execute below commands to install Docker s/w

$ sudo yum update -y
$ sudo yum install docker -y
$ sudo service docker start

# add ec2-user to docker group by executing below command (to give docker permissions to ec2-user accnt)
$ sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

# Close the terminal
$ exit

Then press 'R' to restart the session (This is in MobaXterm)

#execution below command to see docker status

$ docker info

=====================
Basic Docker Commands
=====================

# display docker images available in our machine

$ docker images

# download docker image

$ docker pull <image-name / image-id>

# Run docker image

$ docker run <image-name / image-id>

# Delete docker image

$ docker rmi <image-name / image-id>

# Display all running docker containers

$ docker ps 	

# display all running and stopped containers

$ docker ps -a

# Delete docker container

$  docker rm <container-id>

# Delete docker image forcefully

$  docker rmi  -f <image-id>

# Stop Docker container

$ docker stop <container-id>

# Delete all stopped containers and un-used images and un-used networks

$ docker system prune -a


==========
Dockerfile
=========

-> Dockerfile contains instructions to build docker image

-> In Dockerfile we will use DSL (Domain Specific Language) keywords

-> Docker engine will process Dockerfile instructions from top to bottom

-> Below are the Dockerfile Keywords

FROM
MAINTAINER
COPY
ADD
RUN
CMD
ENTRYPOINT
ENV
LABEL
WORKDIR
EXPOSE
VOLUME



=============
FROM
=============

-> FROM keyword is used represent base image to create our our image
-> On Top of base image our image will be created

Syntax: 

FROM java:jdk-1.8
FROM tomcat:9.5
FROM mysql:6.8
FROM python:3.3


=============
MAINTAINER
=============

-> MAINTAINER keyword is used to specify Dockerfile author information

Syntax:

MAINTAINER  Ashok <ashok.b@oracle.com>


=======
COPY
=======

-> COPY command is used to copy the files from source to destination while creating docker image

Syntax:

COPY <source-location>  <destination-location>

Ex: 

COPY  target/sbi-app.war   /app/tomcat/webapps/sbi-app.war


=======
ADD
=======

-> ADD command is also used to copy files from source to destination while creating docker image

Syntax:

ADD <source-location>  <destination-location>

ADD <url>  <destination-location>

Ex: 

ADD  <URL>   /app/tomcat/webapps/sbi-app.war


Q) What is the difference between COPY and ADD commands ?

-> Using COPY command we can just copy the files from one path to another path with in the machine

-> Using ADD command we can copy files from one path to another path and it supports source location as URL also.


=======
RUN
=======

-> RUN instructions will execute while creating the image

-> Using RUN we can give instructions to docker to execute commands

-> We can write multiple RUN instructions, docker will process all the RUN instructions from top to bottom

Example
-----------

RUN yum install maven
RUN yum install git 
RUN git clone repo-url
RUN mvn clean package


=======
CMD
=======

-> CMD instructions will execute while creating the container

-> Using CMD command we can run our application package file jar / war file

Example
-----------

CMD  sudo start tomcat


Note: If we write multiple CMD instructions also docker will process only last CMD instruction. There is no use of writing multiple CMD instructions in one Dockerfile.


Q) What is the difference between RUN and CMD in Dockerfile ?

-> RUN is used to execute instructions while creating image
-> CMD is used to execute instruction while creating Container

-> We can write multiple RUN instructions in Dockerfile, docker will process all those instructions one by one.
-> If we write multiple CMD instructions in Dockerfile, docker willl process only last CMD instruction.



==================
Sample Dockerfile
=================

FROM ubuntu

MAINTAINER Ashok<ashokit@gmail.com>

RUN echo "Hi, i am RUN-1"

RUN echo "Hi, i am RUN-2"

CMD echo "Hi, I am CMD-1"

RUN echo "Hi, i am RUN-3"

CMD echo "Hi, i am CMD-2"


-> Save the above content in docker file

		filename : Dockerfile


# Command to create docker image using dockerfile

Syntax :   $ docker build  -t  <image-name>  .

Ex :   $ docker build  -t  myfirstimage  .

# Command to run docker image

$ docker run myfirstimage

# Command to login with dockerhub account

$ docker login

Note: We need to enter our dockerhub account credentials correctly (it will ask only first time)

# Command to tag our docker image

$ docker tag  <image-name>  <tag-name>

Ex:  $ docker tag myfirstimage ashokit/myfirstimage

# command to push docker image to docker hub account

$ docker push <tag-name>

Note: Delete all unused images and stopped containers

$ docker system prune -a

# Pull the image from docker hub

$ docker pull ashokit/myfirstimage

# Run the image

$ docker run ashokit/myfirstimage



Note: We can use customized name also for the dockerfile. When we change dockerfile name we need to pass filename as input for docker build command using -f option like below.

$ docker build -f <dockerfile-name>  -t <image-name> .






============
ENTRYPOINT
============

-> ENTRYPOINT instructions will execute while creating container

Syntax
---------

ENTRYPOINT [ "echo"  , "Welcome to Ashok IT" ]

ENTRYPOINT [  "java" , "-jar" , "target/boot-app.jar"  ]


Q) What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT ?

-> We can override CMD instructions in runtime while creating container

-> We can't override ENTRYPOINT instructions

==========
WORKDIR
==========

-> It is used to set working directory for an image / container

Ex: 

WORKDIR     /app/

Note: The Dockerfile instructions which are available after WORKDIR  those instructions will be processed from given working directory.

======
ENV
======

-> ENV is used to set Environment Variables

Ex:

ENV <key> <value>

ENV   java   /etc/softwares/java



====
ARG
====

-> It is used to remove hard coded values

-> Using ARG we can pass values in the runtime like below


Ex:

ARG branch

RUN git clone -b $branch <repo-url>

$ docker build -t imageone --build-arg branch=master


=====
USER
=====

-> We can set user for creating image / container

Note: After USER instruction all the remaining commands will execute with given user permissions


========
EXPOSE
========

-> It is used to specify our container running PORT

Ex: 

EXPOSE 8080


Note: It is just like a documentation command to provide container running port number.

========
VOLUME
========

-> VOLUME is used to specify docker container data storage location.

Note: Volumes are used for storage.

==============================
Dockerize Spring Boot Application
==============================

-> Spring Boot is one ready made java based framework available in the market to develop java based applications quickly

-> Spring Boot is providing emedded server (internal server will be available, we no need configure server for execution)

-> Spring Boot application will be packaged as jar file  (mvn clean package goal will do that package)

Note:  When we do maven package, project jar will be created in project target folder

-> To run spring boot applications we just need to run  jar file like below


		$  java -jar <boot-app-jar-file>


====================================================

FROM openjdk:11

COPY target/spring-boot-docker-app.jar  /usr/app/

WORKDIR /usr/app/

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "spring-boot-docker-app.jar"]

=====================================================

Spring Boot App Git Repo URL : https://github.com/ashokitschool/spring-boot-docker-app.git

# install git client s/w
$ sudo yum install git


# Clone Git Repo
$ git clone https://github.com/ashokitschool/spring-boot-docker-app.git

# Navigating to project folder
$ cd spring-boot-docker-app

# install maven s/w
$ sudo yum install maven

# execute maven goals
$ mvn clean package

Note: After package got success, we can see project jar file in target folder.

# create docker image
